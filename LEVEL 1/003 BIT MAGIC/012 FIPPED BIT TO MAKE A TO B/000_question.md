# Given two numbers A and B. Write a program to count the number of bits needed to be flipped to convert A to B.

Examples:
Input: A = 10, B = 20, Output: 4
Explanation: Binary representation of A is 00001010
Binary representation of B is 00010100
We need to flip highlighted four bits in A to make it B.


Input: A = 7, B = 10, Output: 3
Explanation: Binary representation of A is 00000111
Binary representation of B is 00001010
We need to flip highlighted three bits in A to make it B.
